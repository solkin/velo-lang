# Loops

## While Loop

```velo
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    term.println(i.str);
    i = i + 1;
};
```

## Infinite Loop

```velo
while (true) {
    # Infinite loop
};
```

**Note:** Velo Lang does not have `break` or `continue` operators. Use conditional statements or variable changes to exit loops.
