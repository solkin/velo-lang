# Best Practices

## Naming

- Use clear names for variables and functions
- Function names start with lowercase
- Class names start with uppercase

## Typing

- Use explicit types instead of `any` when possible
- This improves readability and helps avoid errors

## Comments

- Comment complex logic
- Use comments to document functions and classes

## Modularity

- Break large programs into modules
- Use `include` for code reuse
